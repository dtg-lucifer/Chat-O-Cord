# **Chat O Cord**
A full stack chat application made with the power of `React.js` on frontend and the backend supported with `Nest.js`, it has real time chat support with `WebSockets` and audio video chat along with screen sharing with the help of the `WebRTC` api. And for more help we are using lots of open source free to use libraries to manage our workflow.

We are working on the _**Doscord's server**_ functionality where we have more than one text and voice channels to chat with people where people will nee dto have some kind of permissions to have access to those channels. Those permissions will be given the owner or the creator of the server or a person who have wnough permissions to give new permissions to new people.
